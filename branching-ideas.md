# suggestions for branching ideas

## Feature Branching
Feature branching isolates each new feature, bug fix, or task in its own branch created from the main branch. This approach is ideal for individual work or small teams.

## Recommended workflow

- Keep main deployable at all times.
- Use descriptive naming: feature/footer-widgets or bugfix/style-fix.
- Merge only when the feature is complete and reviewed through a pull request.
- Regularly delete merged branches to maintain a clean history.​

### Advantages

Reduces merge conflicts by about 20%.
Speeds up review cycles and keeps history linear with git rebase.
Simplifies testing isolated components before deployments.​


## Typical structure

main: production-ready theme version.
develop: integration branch where feature branches merge first.
feature/*: new feature development.
release/*: final polishing for new versions.
hotfix/*: urgent fixes for production.


### This 

Clearly separates development, staging, and production environments.
Allows simultaneous long-term development and urgent updates.
Improves coordination between developers, designers, and testers.​

## Implementation Tips for WordPress Themes

- Only version control the wp-content/themes/your-theme directory and optionally custom plugins.
- Store configuration files (style.css, functions.php, theme.json) and template parts in Git while keeping uploads excluded via .gitignore.
- Tag stable theme releases (e.g., v1.2.0) for easy deployment rollbacks.
- Enforce code reviews via pull requests before merging to main.
- Integrate GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD tools for automatic linting and WordPress environment tests.​
